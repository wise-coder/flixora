## Installing from Pypi

We shall be using [uv tool](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

### With required dependencies

=== "Install"

    ```sh
    uv pip install moviebox-api
    ```

=== "Add to project"

    ```sh
    uv add moviebox-api
    ```
### With [commandline](./v1/cli.md) extra dependencies

=== "Install"

    ```sh
    uv pip install "moviebox-api[cli]"
    ```

=== "Add to project"

    ```sh
    uv add "moviebox-api[cli]"
    ```

!!! important "CLI utils"
    At some point, developers may want to make use of CLI utility functions for operations such as prompting users to choose the movie quality to be processed, etc. This will require the commandline extra dependencies to be installed.

## Installing from source

If you like new features before official releases:

=== "Install"

    ```sh
    uv pip install git+https://github.com/Simatwa/moviebox-api.git[cli]
    ```

=== "Add to project"

    ```sh
    uv add git+https://github.com/Simatwa/moviebox-api.git[cli]
