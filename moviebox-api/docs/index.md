## Versions Available

There are 3 versions currently supported, each targeting a distinct API surface of the **Moviebox** provider. They differ in protocol approach, backend endpoint, authentication requirements, and data fidelity.

---

### v1 — Web Scraper + Partial REST-API Client
**Endpoint:** `h5.aoneroom.com`

Operates against h5.aoneroom.com. Combines HTML scraping with partial REST-API interaction, making it suitable for content discovery where structured API access is limited or inconsistent. Scraping logic handles page-rendered data not exposed via JSON endpoints.

- Approach: Hybrid (DOM scraping + REST)
- Target surface: H5 mobile web interface
- Use case: Content listing, metadata extraction from web-rendered pages
- Limitations: Susceptible to markup changes; partial API coverage only

---

### v2 — Pure REST-API Client
**Endpoint:** `h5-api.aoneroom.com`

Targets the dedicated REST-API backend powering the H5 web interfaces - [moviebox.ph, moviebox.pk, videodownloader.site etc](https://github.com/Simatwa/moviebox-api/issues/27). Eliminates scraping entirely in favor of structured JSON request/response cycles. Provides more stable and predictable data access compared to v1.

- Approach: Pure REST-API
- Target surface: H5 API backend
- Use case: Structured content queries, metadata retrieval, stream resolution
- Advantages over v1: No markup dependency; cleaner response parsing; more reliable

---

### v3 — Android App REST-API Client
**Endpoints:** `api3.aoneroom.com` through `api6.aoneroom.com`

Targets the API cluster used by the native Moviebox Android application. Operates against multiple rotating API subdomains (`api3`–`api6`), reflecting the app's load-balanced backend. Typically exposes higher data fidelity, broader content coverage, and app-exclusive endpoints not available via the H5 surfaces.

- Approach: Pure REST-API
- Target surface: Android app backend (multi-host)
- Use case: Full content catalog access, app-tier stream quality, extended metadata
- Advantages over v1/v2: Wider endpoint coverage; app-grade API access; multi-host failover support
